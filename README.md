#Student Final Project

Students will be editing student.py while all the functions they need will be provided in project.py. The file will be imported and all the proper documentation will be provided for what each function does.

If a student does not have the Raspberry Pi camera, they will use capture.sh but the one for the raspberry pi camera will be in capture2.sh
